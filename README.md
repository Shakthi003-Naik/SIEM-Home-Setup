# SIEM-Home-Setup


## Elastic Stack SIEM Home Lab Setup

### Overview
This repository contains the configuration files, scripts, and documentation for setting up an Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab using a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). This lab is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with Elastic SIEM by generating and analyzing security events in a controlled environment.

### Features
- **Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration:** Step-by-step guide to set up Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment.
- **Kali Linux VM Deployment:** Instructions on how to install and configure a Kali Linux VM.
- **Security Event Simulation:** Scripts and examples for generating security events using Nmap.
- **Alerting:** Set up and manage alert rules to detect specific security incidents.

### Usage
1. Use the `nmap_scan.sh` script to generate security events on the Kali VM.
2. Analyze and visualize the results in the Elastic SIEM dashboard.
3. Configure alerts to monitor for specific security events.
